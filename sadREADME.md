This is the sadREADME.md file. 



We spent 1.5 hours trying to get this assignment setup. Ty and Albert claimed that they had theirs 
working right at setup, with autotest working and all, and so we tried to get that resolved.
After no success, we tried even more methods, googled everything we could think of,
rebuilt the Cloud9 a second time, went through everything we thought of again, and then gave up on that. 

Later that night I (Blake) spoke with Ty and Ty said, "Well we just used rspec anyways." 
I went and experimented with this for another 30 minutes to see if I could make any progress on the assignment. 
We worked again on Monday night for 1.5 hours. We figured out part 1 after about 30 minutes (sort of), and then spent 
the rest of our time attempting part 2. The main frustration here was that we did not entirely understand 
what was being asked, as we re-read and re-read the wall of text trying to piece together what exactly it 
was that they wanted us to do. We got the "spellcheck" test to work, and the "unknown" test to work,
but the steps involving taking in arrays with varying values did not make any sense. It was at this point
that we decided that we had spent enough time on the assignment and were not making any progress. 


Michael and Noah were working along side us for the last 1.5 hours of our efforts. They helped us 
get a couple of our tests from part 2 working, but then Noah started guessing at things and becoming 
flustered and we decided to not follow in route, given our already frustrated state.
